## Project Description

>here is a quote

The aim of our project was to create a playlist recommendation system, whereby given some set of songs in a playlist we would generate some distinct set of songs that a user would be likely to enjoy given what they had added to their playlist. Given the prevalence of modern music streaming applications like Spotify, Pandora, and Apple Music, where millions of users consistently are consistently generating playlists and looking for new music to explore these systems have many real world applications.

In creating our playlist recommender we had access to three main datasets, the Spotify Million Playlist dataset, the last.fm Million Song Dataset, and the Spotify API which provides quantitative metrics about a given track such as tempo.
